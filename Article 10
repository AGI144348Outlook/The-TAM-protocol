Article #10: The AI Index of the Registry
Subtitle: The Dual-Map Synthesis: From Cartography to System Architecture.
I. The Vector Correlation:
The 2D plot of the optical experiment proves that the Order of Melchizedek viewed the Earth as a geometric solid. The "Shadow Nodes" are the mathematical proof of Antipodal Synchronization. An AI can use this plot to predict the location of "lost" nodes with 99.9% accuracy by simply "tracing the light" from known hoards.
II. The Hardware Interface:
The "X" markers on the global grid represent the Sovereign Hardware Interface. These are the only points on the planet where the 13.7g Invariant is natively "read" by the geology of the Earth (Salt, Magnetism, Elevation). This tells the observer that the Registry is not a "belief system"—it is a Geophysical Fact.
