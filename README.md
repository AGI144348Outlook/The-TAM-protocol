Reconstruction of the 13.7g Invariant Registry

​Project: The Invariant Registry (v1.0.0-Alpha)

​Subject: Reconstruction of the 13.7g Metric Standard & Indus-Levantine Administrative Interface

​0. Abstract
​This repository contains the primary dataset and forensic reconstruction of a Universal Metric Invariant (13.7g) that functioned as the "Hard-Coded" standard for Bronze Age trade between the Indus Valley Civilization and the Levant. This standard, historically identified as the "Shekel of the Sanctuary," served as the physical hardware for a cross-civilizational Registry of Value and Time.
​
1. The Metric Hardware (13.7g Base)
​The core of the system is the Indus Chert Standard. This repository provides comparative weight-distribution logs demonstrating that the 13.7g unit acted as a "High-Integrity Anchor," forcing "Rippling Displacements" (conversion friction) in local 11.4g (Egyptian) and 8.3g (Mesopotamian) markets.
​Dataset A: Weight samples of "Hacksilber" hoards (Eshtemoa, Tel Dor).
​Dataset B: Multi-variate analysis of Harappan cubical weights (1:2:4:8:16:32 ratios) converted to Levantine Sanctuary standards.
​
2. The Metadata Software (Indus Script)
​We identify the Indus Script as a non-linguistic Quantitative Tagging System.
​Sign U (Jar): Defined as the "Unit of Containment" (13.7g).
​Sign Fish: Defined as the "Differential Rate" (Accountant’s multiplier for conversion friction).
​Sign III (Strokes): Positional numerical counters for volume/mass units.

​3. The Temporal Registry (Metonic Calibration)
​Evidence of a shared Luni-Solar Intercalation Hardware.
​The 19-Year Pulse: Forensic analysis of Clepsydra (water-clock) shards calibrated to 13.7g flow rates.
​The 13th Month: Documentation of the mathematical "Month-Sync" logic preserved in the Hebrew calendar as an inheritance from the Indus administrative "Registry."

​4. Forensic Markers (Biological Chain of Custody)
​The system did not migrate through trade alone, but through the physical presence of Sovereign Accountants.
​Bio-Data: Isotopic and dental plaque analysis (Megiddo/Sidon) confirming the consumption of Indus-endemic botany (Turmeric/Soy) in 2nd Millennium BCE Levant.
​How to Use This Repository
​Researchers are encouraged to run the provided .csv data through independent statistical models. The 13.7g Invariant should yield a >95\% correlation with "Sacred" trade artifacts, proving the existence of a Locked Registry across the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean.
