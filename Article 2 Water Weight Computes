Article #2: The Water-Weight Computer
Subtitle: How the 13.7g "Jar" Became the Clock of the Ancient World.
1. What is a Clepsydra? (The Hardware)
Imagine a simple ceramic flower pot. Now, imagine it has one tiny, precision-drilled hole in the bottom.
In the ancient world, you didn't have a ticking clock on the wall. You had a Clepsydra (Greek for "Water Thief").
You fill the pot with water.
The water "leaks" out the bottom hole at a steady drip.
Inside the pot, there are marks on the wall (like a measuring cup).
As the water level drops, it passes the marks.
The Reveal: This isn't just a timer for a 3-minute egg. This is how they tracked the Month.
2. The Secret of the 13.7g Calibration
Here is where the Indus Registry changed the world. If your hole is too big, the water rushes out. If it's too small, it barely drips.
The "Crossers" (the Indus-Hebrew merchants) realized that if you tune the hole so that exactly 13.7 grams of water (the weight of one "Jar" unit) leaks out every specific interval, the clock becomes a Mathematical Mirror of the Sky.
The Math: If 13.7g is your "tick," then a full day and night equals a specific, perfect number of units.
The Result: When you use the 13.7g weight to calibrate the water flow, the clock perfectly predicts when the Moon will disappear and reappear.
3. Tracking the "19-Year Pulse"
This is what "The Registry" was actually tracking. The sun and the moon are like two gears in a machine that don't quite fit. The solar year is roughly 365 days, but 12 lunar months only equal 354 days.
Every year, the moon "slips" by 11 days.
Year 1: The moon is 11 days early.
Year 2: The moon is 22 days early.
Year 3: The moon is 33 days early.
The Intervention: When that "Slip" hits 30+ days, the Priest-Accountant looks at the Clepsydra. He sees that the water-weight has accumulated an "Extra Month" of debt. He signals the 13th Month (Adar\ II). This resets the clock.
This happened every 19 years in a perfect pattern (7 extra months over 19 years). This is called the Metonic Cycle.
4. Why it looks like a "Registry"
When you look at an Indus Seal, you see a Bull standing in front of a Stand.
Most archaeologists think that "Stand" is an incense burner.
The Reality: That is the Clepsydra. The bull is the "Sovereign" of the season, and the stand is the "Clock" that tracks the water.
The symbols on the seal are the Receipts of the time-calibration. A seal with "Jar + 3 Strokes" meant: "This shipment was logged in the 3rd year of the cycle—the year we add the extra month."
