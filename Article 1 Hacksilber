THE-TAM-PROTOCOL
(Sub-title: Reconstruction of the 13.7g Invariant Registry)
​The name utilizes the "TAM" (The Closing Bracket/The Finish) and frames the entire Indus-Hebrew link as a Protocol—a set of rules that governs a system.

​I. Abstract: The Physics of Economic Friction
​Decipherment of the Indus Script has historically failed by treating the symbols as phonetic or purely logographic. This study proposes that the script functions as Administrative Metadata for a "High-Integrity" metric hardware. We document the Metric Shock—the systemic displacement caused when the Indus 13.7g standard entered the 11.4g and 8.3g markets of the Near East.
​II. The "Hardware" Conflict (Hardware vs. Hardware)
​Every economic system has a "Zero Point" of integrity. In the 2nd Millennium BCE, the Indus 13.7g chert weight was the most precise mass-standard in the ancient world.
​The Invariant: 13.7g (The Indus "Jar" Unit).
​The Local Friction: The Levantine "Common" Shekel (11.4g) and the Mesopotamian Shekel (8.3g).
​The Displacement: When these systems met, they did not blend. Instead, a third layer of "Accounting Friction" was created to bridge the gap.
​III. Forensic Case Study: The Eshtemoa Silver Hoard
​The Eshtemoa Hoard (Judean Highlands) contains five jugs filled with over 26kg of "Hacksilber" (cut silver).
​The Mathematical Discrepancy: Standard archaeological analysis struggles to explain the weight distribution of these silver scraps using local 11.4g metrics.
​The 13.7g Calibration: When the data is re-calculated using the Indus 13.7g Standard, the "scraps" resolve into perfect fractions:
​6.85g (The Beqa/Half-Unit)
​3.42g (The Quarter-Unit)
​The Conclusion: The silver was physically "hacked" to satisfy the requirements of a Registry that demanded the 13.7g Indus standard. This is physical proof of the "Metric Shock" in action.
​IV. The "Meluhha Weights" Ledger
​We cite the Mari Tablet A.432 and Ugarit RS 15.10, which explicitly mention "Weights of the Meluhha" (Indus). These tablets are not just mentions; they are Dispute Ledgers. They record the "Friction" of merchants complaining about the conversion rates between the "High-Integrity" Eastern stone and the local King's stone.
